# Error Handling considerations for the Data Ingestion Group

| Type                  | Example                                 | Strategy                         |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------- |----------------------------------|
| **Transient Errors**  | Timeouts, rate limits, network glitches | Retry with backoff, we can use   |
| **Persistent Errors** | Invalid format, missing SKU fields      | Send to Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)  |
| **System Failures**   | Service crash, queue overflow           | Alert + restart via orchestrator |

## Error Handling Strategies
- **Transient Errors**: 
  - Implement retry logic with exponential backoff for transient errors like timeouts, rate limits, and network glitches.
  - Use a circuit breaker pattern to prevent overwhelming the system during high-load periods, like Resilience4J. or Spring Cloud Circuit Breaker.
  - SQS can be configured to retry messages automatically for a certain number of attempts before sending them to the Dead Letter Queue (DLQ).
  - Ideally, retry policies should be configurable to allow for different retry strategies based on the type of error/criticality/or vendor of the data.
  - DLQs -- persist messages that cannot be processed after a certain number of retries, allowing for manual inspection and reprocessing later.
    - We need to expose a UI to inspect and reprocess messages in the DLQ.:
    - trigger manual or batch reprocessing of messages from the DLQ.
## Alerting and Monitoring
- **System Failures**: 
  - Implement health checks and monitoring for all services to detect system failures.
  - Develop signalFX or Prometheus metrics to track service health, queue lengths, and processing times.
  - Use tools like Prometheus and Grafana for real-time monitoring and alerting.
  - Set up alerts for critical errors, such as service crashes or queue overflows, to notify the operations team.
  - Use Kubernetes or similar orchestrators to automatically restart failed services.
  - Logging and tracing should be implemented to capture detailed error information for debugging across the ingestion pipeline and over a multitude of services.
  - Use a centralized logging solution like ELK Stack or Splunk to aggregate logs from all services.
